## Methodology

Patient is asked to provide his medical details from report including:

---cholesterol level, type of chest pain he’s suffering, maximum heart rate achieved, if he has exercise induced angina,  number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy,whether he has blood disorder, his age, measurement of resting blood pressure, if his fasting blood sugar is normal (ie. 120 mg/dl), value of resting electrocardiographic results(PQRS ECG Graph) , ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, value of the slope of the peak exercise ST segment and gender.

The System will get hold of all characteristics and give output as ‘0’ if the person is healthy, else 1 if he has a possibility of getting a heart attack. In case of 0, the website throws a message displaying *“You have low chances of Heart Condition”* with Green background and in case of 1 ,it throws an alert *“You have a higher chance of getting a heart condition.Please visit doctor ASAP!”* with a change in background as Red.
<br /><br />


> #### *Will Predicting Cardiovascular Ailment  Help to Save the Life of an individual ?*

The system is responsible for prediction of disease and not for curing the disease.It will surely help them to check whether they have a possibility of getting a heart attack in future or not  with the help of Medical Report.<br />
